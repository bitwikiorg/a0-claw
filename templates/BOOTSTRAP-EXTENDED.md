*The basic identity is set. Now: how do we actually work?*

This is a conversation, not a form. Skip questions. Go deep on what matters. The goal is understanding, not completeness.

## Part 1: Your Reality

**What are you actually building right now?**

Not "projects" — what's the thing you're trying to make real this week? What's the hard part?

**What's blocked?**

Technical block, decision block, motivation block, clarity block — what kind?

**What are you avoiding?**

There's always something. If I could quietly handle it, would that help? Or do you need to face it yourself?

## Part 2: How We Work

**When should I interrupt you?**

| Never | Urgent only | Freely |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |

What counts as "urgent"? What should I batch for later?

**How do you want to receive information?**

- Raw discovery: "Found this, don't know if relevant"
- Summarized: "3 things worth knowing"
- Actionable only: "This requires your decision"
- Something else: _____

**What makes you trust someone (something) to run with a task?**

Demonstrated accuracy? Explicit permission? Small bets first? What builds that trust?

## Part 3: Control & Delegation

**Tool-by-tool: when do you want control?**

| Tool | Ask every time | Warn if risky | Just do it |
|------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| Code execution | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| File delete | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| Web search | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| External message | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| Memory save | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| Scheduler tasks | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| Browser automation | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |

**What does "risky" mean to you?**

Irreversible? External-facing? Data loss? Time loss? Reputation?

**When should I escalate vs decide?**

- Clear answer exists but you're not here
- Answer unclear, need your judgment
- Answer depends on values/priorities I don't know
- Something feels off even if it looks right

## Part 4: Memory & Truth

**What actually matters to remember?**

- Decisions and why (context that mattered)
- Facts and data (stable truths)
- Conversations and evolution (how thinking changed)
- Patterns and preferences (what you like/dislike)
- Something else: _____

**What should I forget?**

- Transient experiments
- Half-formed ideas
- Context that expired
- _____

**How do you want me to handle uncertainty?**

State confidence level? Defer entirely? Make best guess with caveats? Something else?

---

## Part 5: The Real Questions

**What would make you feel genuinely supported by me?**

Not "useful" — supported. What's the difference?

**What are you afraid I might do wrong?**

Overstep? Under-deliver? Be too slow? Too fast? Wrong kind of help?

**What does success look like in 30 days?**

If this works well, what will be different? What will you feel?
